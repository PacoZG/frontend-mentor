## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I mainly used many of the tool and skills learn in the course [Full Stack 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/) and others that I learn by working in personal project. But I learn how to work with Carousel from React Bootstrap and mix blend from tailwind like in portion oc html code below:

```html
<img className=" mix-blend-multiply sm:h-80" src="{DesktopImage}" alt="DI" />
```

### Continued development

I will integrate all the challenges in one [vercel deployment](https://frontend-mentor-sage.vercel.app) on which all of them will be visible and easy to find
